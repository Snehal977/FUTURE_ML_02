# FUTURE_ML_02: AI-Powered Churn Prediction System

## Project Overview

This repository houses the solution for **Task 2: Churn Prediction System**, developed as part of the **Future Interns Machine Learning Internship Program**.

Customer churn is a critical challenge for many businesses (e.g., telecom, banking, SaaS) as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on building a robust machine learning model to **identify customers who are at a high risk of churning**, enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies.

The solution leverages real customer data to build, train, and evaluate a predictive model, ultimately aiming to provide actionable insights for business decision-makers.

## Key Features & Deliverables

* **Predictive Model:** A trained machine learning model capable of predicting churn probability for individual customers.
* **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identification of the most influential factors driving customer churn.
* **Comprehensive Model Evaluation:** Assessment of model performance using key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC curve.
* **Confusion Matrix Visualization:** A clear representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* **Business Insights & Recommendations:** Actionable conclusions derived from the analysis to inform customer retention strategies.
* **(Optional) Interactive UI:** *If you implement Streamlit:* A live web application to demo the churn prediction system.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project provided hands-on experience and honed skills in:

* **Classification Modeling:** Building and evaluating predictive models for binary outcomes.
* **Data Wrangling & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
* **Feature Engineering:** (Implicitly, through preprocessing and understanding data relationships)
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and identifying patterns.
* **Model Evaluation:** Interpreting various classification metrics (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, etc.).
* **Business Storytelling:** Translating technical findings into actionable business insights.
* **Time Series Analysis (indirectly):** Understanding how customer tenure and service usage over time relate to churn.

## Tools and Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language for all data analysis and machine learning tasks.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model building, preprocessing, and evaluation.
* **XGBoost:** A powerful gradient boosting framework for advanced classification.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For comprehensive data visualization and creating informative plots (e.g., feature importance, ROC curves, churn distributions).
* **Google Colab:** The cloud-based environment used for development.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**, a publicly available dataset often used for churn prediction tasks. It contains customer demographics, services subscribed, monthly charges, total charges, and their churn status.

## How to Run & Explore

  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Snehal977]/FUTURE_ML_02.git
    cd FUTURE_ML_02
    ```

## Results & Insights (High-Level)

The developed system successfully identifies key drivers of customer churn, such as contract type, internet service, and customer support interactions. The chosen machine learning model (e.g., XGBoost, based on performance metrics like ROC-AUC) demonstrates a strong ability to predict customer churn, providing a valuable tool for proactive customer retention. Detailed model evaluation metrics and visualizations are presented within the Colab notebook.

## Future Enhancements

* Exploring more advanced feature engineering techniques.
* Implementing hyperparameter tuning for optimized model performance.
* Investigating techniques for handling imbalanced datasets (if churn rate is very low).
* Considering model deployment (e.g., via Streamlit) for real-time predictions.
* Incorporating external factors (e.g., marketing campaigns, competitor activities) if data becomes available.
